# C-Blunt

Fully functioning programming language created using C-Sharp

## Usage
This is an interpreted programming language, so code is read line-by-line. 

Current functionality only include basic arithmetics with integers and floating point numbers, but other features such as variables, functions, if statements will be added.

Conversion between int and float is handled with the same rules as C-Sharp, with the exception of integer and float division, in which the result is manually converted into floating point for more accurate results. E.g int(5) / int(3) == int(1) **but** float(5) / int(3) = float(1.6666667).
